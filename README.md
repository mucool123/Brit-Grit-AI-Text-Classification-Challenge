# Brit-Grit-AI-Text-Classification-Challenge

## Project Description:
I participated in the AI Generated Text Classification Challenge hosted by bitgrit Inc. The challenge aimed to develop a machine learning algorithm to distinguish between text generated by AI and text generated by humans. The dataset included word embeddings, word count, and punctuation count as features for each text entry. My project focused on creating an effective classification model to identify AI-generated text from human-generated text.

## Summary of my Contribution:
In the AI Generated Text Classification Challenge, I achieved an impressive F1 score of 70. This score reflects my ability to build a robust machine learning model capable of differentiating between texts generated by AI and those created by humans. By leveraging word embeddings, word count, and punctuation count, I developed a solution that addresses the critical issue of identifying AI-generated content. This project highlights my proficiency in machine learning and data analysis and demonstrates my dedication to solving real-world problems using AI technology.
